When Steve Job's [biography by Walter Isaacson](http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Walter-Isaacson/697650) came out last year, there was one passage that really resonated with me. In the last chapter, the book concludes with some comments from Steve. 

> I hate it when people call themselves "entrepreneurs" when what they're really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They're unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business.
> That's how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will still stand for something a generation or two from now. That's what Walt Disney did, and Hewlet and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That's what I want Apple to be.

This one passage has stuck with me ever since reading Steve's biography. And it's what makes Apple such a remarkable company. I would love to be part of company where everyone is devoted to making the best possible products. A company filled with craftsman that care and love what they build. When I come across any new startup I always judge it's founders and their goals to those final words.  Does this company truely want to build great products that improve peoples lives, or are they looking for a quick way to cash out and move on to the next thing.
