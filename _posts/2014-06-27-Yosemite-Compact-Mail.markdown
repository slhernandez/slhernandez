I created this quick concept while reading Apple's [marketing material](http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/) on their upcoming OS X update, Yosemite. I am really excited about the new user experience that is packaged in Yosemite.  It looks like a substantial update to Apple's philosophy of UI and design experience.  While viewing the marketing images of the new OS, I decided to create a quick mockup of Mail.  I imagined how it would look as a compact list of message for quick consumption. A quick drawer will pop out whenever you select a message. 
The typeface is Helvetica Neue and the icons are from [Streamline Icons](http://www.streamlineicons.com/).  The mockup itself was created with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)

<div class="post-image">

  <p class="caption">Simple Yosemite OS X theme for mail messages.</p>
</div> 

Shown above is how the message notification would compliment the app. Okay, I think I am done with creating Mail mockups that will never exist.  It was fun to piece this together and experiment.
