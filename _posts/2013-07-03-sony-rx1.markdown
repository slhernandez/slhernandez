Just recently, I been spending a quite of bit time with my new Sony RX1 full-frame camera.  I realize this camera is for the professional photographer.  I am far from a professional.  I wouldn't even call my self a novice photographer.  But I couldn't help being attracted to such a piece of technology that excels in creating some stunning photographs.  This camera with it's full-frame sensor and fixed 35mm F3 lens has taken some breath taking photographs.  The results from this camera have exceeded my expectations.  Below are small sample of photos that I have taken.
