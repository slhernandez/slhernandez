    <h2 class="about-intro">Hello, my name is Steve Hernandez. I build and design user interfaces for a living. I make things for the web. This personal website is devoted to my designs.</h2>
    <div class="about-copy-container">
      <p class="about-copy-paragraph_1">Hey there. I am a front-end engineer based in Austin, TX. I specialize in creating <a href="http://blog.andyet.com/2015/01/22/native-web-apps">Native Web Apps</a> using JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. The majority of my free time is spent on experimenting and exploring new libraries and client-side tools for web applications. I am also a visual designer who thinks in code. All that means is when I design a UI, I usually go from <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch (by Bohemiancoding)</a> to HTML/CSS3/JavaScript. My interests are in JavaScript, CSS, Typography, User Experience and Visual Design. </p>

      <p class="about-copy-paragraph_2">My personal website is my playground.  There is no intended audience except myself.    It's primarily the place where I talk about visual design and the lessons I have learned.  My goal for the website is to show a catalog of personal projects and designs.  It will be very helpful to look back on how my design philosophy and aesthetic has changed over the years.  I hope this website will continue to push me to create visuals that are everlasting and timeless.  This website is a creative outlet for me without any self-censorship or audience consideration.</p>
